# Standard library

An overview of the ML standard library.

## Motivation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ported functions from the c library are regarded as unsafe in terms of type and memory safety, unlike their ML counterparts. Using c bindings should be avoided where safer ML libraries are available.

The standard library permits the use of both unsafe c standard library functions (for embedded systems and nostalgic c programmers) and their safe ML counterparts, plus some other useful modern libraries, like `string` and `convert`.
