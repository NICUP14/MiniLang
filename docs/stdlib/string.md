# String library

Source: [include/stdlib/string.ml](../../include/stdlib/string.ml)

Provides a functional-like ML frontend of the sds c library. The functions behave like pure ones.

**Check out [sds](https://github.com/antirez/sds)**, the string library couldn't be made possible without without this c library.

> Functions of sds c library are not pure, unlike their ML counterparts.

> [!WARNING]
> Relies on the sds bindings for ML (string-backend.ml).
